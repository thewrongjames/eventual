    <p>
      This website will provide you with API access to the events on a Facebook
      page that you are an admin on that you authorise by logging in to
      Facebook and selecting that page. This might be useful if you want a
      static site to be able to access them without doing any
      log-in-with-Facebook shenanigans, and you find the events component that
      facebook already offers to be too limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sign in, give eventual management access to only the page with the events
      that you want to share, and they will be made publically available at a
      URL that will be listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get rid of all the information we have on you and the page, log in if
      you haven't already, click the "Delete All Data" button that will appear
      below when logged in, and then log out.
